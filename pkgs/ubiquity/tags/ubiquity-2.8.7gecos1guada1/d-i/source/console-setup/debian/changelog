console-setup (1.57ubuntu1) natty; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Reset keyboard-configuration/toggle to the default if it's set to "No
      toggling" and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Fixed to VGA for Lat15; while it's not
      entirely complete, it looks better and is largely good enough.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible and sensible.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Set default for Dutch to us(intl), not just us.
    - Set default layout for Vietnam to 'us'.
    - Set default layout for Kurdish to tr(ku).
    - Stop running debconf-updatepo on clean.
    - Update for new layouts and variants for Montenegro and Serbia, and
      migrate configuration files from the old layouts.
    - Add a "Do not configure keyboard; keep kernel keymap" model option,
      preseedable by keyboard-configuration/modelcode=SKIP.
    - Drop the layout/variant priority to high on fresh installs.
    - Honour OVERRIDE_ALLOW_PRESEEDING environment variable when deciding
      whether to allow preseeding, which is ordinarily only allowed in d-i.
    - If keyboard-configuration/layoutcode is preseeded but not marked as
      seen, then set the default layout but don't lower the layout question
      priority or preseed console-setup/ask_detect.
    - Add an apport hook.
    - Generate a locale locally for translating keyboard names in
      kbdnames-maker.
    - Replace usplash detection code with Plymouth detection code.
    - Move boot tasks to a combination of two udev rules and a single
      Upstart job, ensuring that they're run at points when we are able to
      satisfy the constraints on the relevant ioctls.
    - Depend on kbd (>= 1.15-1ubuntu3) for a valuable loadkeys improvement.
    - Don't try to call update-rc.d if it doesn't exist, such as in d-i.
    - Don't gzip font or ACM files in /etc/console-setup/.  The space saving
      is negligible, and it's more efficient not to need to uncompress them
      at boot time.
    - Remove iconv transliteration.  We don't use non-UTF-8 locales, and it
      breaks ubiquity as we haven't generated the configured locale by the
      time we hit console-setup.
  * Go back to always asking layout before variant.
  * Migrate from old console-setup/* to new keyboard-configuration/*
    question names.
  * Use the default keyboard model if an existing configuration file sets
    XKBMODEL="".
  * Exit cleanly from initramfs hook if /etc/default/keyboard or
    /etc/default/console-setup don't exist for some reason (LP: #634402).
  * Fix description of upstart job to not incorrectly claim that it sets the
    font (LP: #632366).

console-setup (1.34ubuntu1) karmic; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
      and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Fixed to VGA for Lat15; while it's not
      entirely complete, it looks better and is largely good enough.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Set default for Dutch to us(intl), not just us.
    - Set default layout for Vietnam to 'us'.
    - Set default layout for Kurdish to tr(ku).
    - Fix handling of commas in layout and variant names.
    - debian/config.proto: Set sparc default model to pc105.
    - Remove 'exit 0' from the end of debian/config.proto; this will be
      sourced from the postinst in the installer, and exiting in the
      successful case means that /etc/default/console-setup never gets
      generated.
    - Stop running debconf-updatepo on clean.
    - Update for new layouts and variants for Japan, Montenegro, and Serbia,
      and migrate configuration files from the old layouts.
    - Add a "Do not configure keyboard; keep kernel keymap" model option,
      preseedable by console-setup/modelcode=SKIP.
    - Drop the layout/variant priority to high on fresh installs.
    - Honour OVERRIDE_ALLOW_PRESEEDING environment variable when deciding
      whether to allow preseeding, which is ordinarily only allowed in d-i.
    - If console-setup/layoutcode is preseeded but not marked as seen, then
      set the default layout but don't lower the layout question priority or
      preseed console-setup/ask_detect.
    - Treat the Kazakhstan layout (kz) as non-Latin.

  * Better Arabic letters for VGA16 fonts.  Thanks to Ahmed El-Mahmoudy,
    closes: #485921.
  * I was suggested to use VGA font face instead of Terminus by
    default. Unfortunately in most cases VGA is incomplete so in these
    cases I used Fixed.  I don't think Fixed is better choice than
    Terminus so feel free to revert the defaults back to Terminus, they
    are in debian/config.proto around line 1770.  Thanks to Josh Triplett,
    closes: #497331.
  * Give VoidSymbol to plain or shifted PrintScreen key.  Patch provided
    by Colin Watson.  Thanks to Jason Spiro, closes: #501654.
  * Do not use Shift_Lock instead of Caps_Lock.  Use CtrlL_Lock for
    keymaps that need this.  Closes: #514212.  The idea was given by
    Samuel Thibault.  He also provided a patch for proper locale-based
    capitalization of the letters.
  * Do not ignore XF86_Switch_VT_* xkeysyms, closes: #514537.   Patch
    provided by Samuel Thibault.
  * Recognise the braille keys, closes: #514539.  Patch provided by Samuel
    Thibault.
  * Allow to specify more than one font in the configuration file in
    FONT=...  Thanks to Samuel Thibault, closes: #508862.
  * On first install read defaults for the keyboard layout from
    /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  Julien Cristau provided the script parsing
    xorg.conf. Closes: #515685.
  * Save cached keymap in /etc/console-setup/cached.kmap.gz if possible.
    Thanks to Frédéric Boiteux, closes: #509117.
  * Fix a bug: empty string as keyboard model in the config file when the
    user selects the default keyboard model.
  * Do not display error template when debconf doesn't support the layout in
    the config file.  Ask the user if the settings must be preserved.
    Debconf questions when the default values for layout or options
    (coming most likely from xorg.conf) are not supported.
  
  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Fix property counts in Goha and legacy BDF fonts.
    - Fix keymap reduction not to try to express keymap A in terms of keymap
      B when B includes keys not mapped by A.
    - If reading a user configuration file, disable --save, and don't use
      /etc/console-setup/cached.kmap.gz; using the cached file tends to
      cause confusion here since the maintainer scripts and init scripts are
      expecting that to correspond to the main configuration (LP: #332728).
    - Raise priority to critical for questions preseeded with a nonexistent
      code (LP: #328078).
  * Sort the null variant to the top of the choices list rather than to the
    bottom.
  * Make %.ekmap target depend on MyKeyboardNames.pl.
  * Use printf rather than /bin/echo in setupcon; it's typically a shell
    builtin and is therefore faster.

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
      and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Terminus to VGA where supported.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Disable workaround in ckbcomp for the kernel not applying Caps Lock to
      non-ASCII letters, except for Turkish layouts; the cure is worse than
      the disease because it makes Caps Lock equivalent to Shift Lock.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Set default for Dutch to us(intl), not just us.
    - Set default layout for Vietnam to 'us'.
    - Set default layout for Kurdish to tr(ku).
    - Fix handling of commas in layout and variant names.
    - Fix keymap reduction not to try to express keymap A in terms of keymap
      B when B includes keys not mapped by A.
    - debian/config.proto: Set sparc default model to pc105.
    - Remove 'exit 0' from the end of debian/config.proto; this will be
      sourced from the postinst in the installer, and exiting in the
      successful case means that /etc/default/console-setup never gets
      generated.
    - Stop running debconf-updatepo on clean.
    - Update for new layouts and variants for Japan, Montenegro, and Serbia,
      and migrate configuration files from the old layouts.
    - Add a "Do not configure keyboard; keep kernel keymap" model option,
      preseedable by console-setup/modelcode=SKIP.
    - Drop the layout/variant priority to high on fresh installs.
    - Honour OVERRIDE_ALLOW_PRESEEDING environment variable when deciding
      whether to allow preseeding, which is ordinarily only allowed in d-i.
    - If console-setup/layoutcode is preseeded but not marked as seen, then
      set the default layout but don't lower the layout question priority or
      preseed console-setup/ask_detect.
    - Fix property counts in Goha and legacy BDF fonts.

  * Correct "Provides:" in console-setup init script to allow insserv
    to insert console-setup properly in the boot sequence.
    Thanks to Petter Reinholdtsen for the patch. Closes: #458486
  * Add the required "Default-Stop" and "Required-Stop" fields in the
    init.d/console-setup script.
  * Set myself as Uploader.
  * Fixing lintian warnings:
    - Remove "perl, libxml-parser-perl" from Build-Depends. They were
      duplicated in Build-Depends-Indep
    - Do not ignore non-zero exit status of "make maintainer-clean" in the
      clean target
    - Turn console-setup/dont_ask_layout into an error template. That'll
      get rid of the lintian warning and this is more accurate anyway.
  * Fixing lintian errors:
    - No longer install an example file in 
      /usr/share/doc/console-setup-mini/examples/console-setup
      for the udeb package

  [ Petter Reinholdtsen ]

console-setup (1.19ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of
      the pc105 model.
    - If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
      (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
      detect the keyboard layout.
    - Only default to Canadian layout for fr_CA; use U.S. English for other
      *_CA locales.
    - Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
      and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Terminus to VGA where supported.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
      /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init. Similarly,
      ensure that the font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial
      installation.
    - Disable workaround in ckbcomp for the kernel not applying Caps Lock to
      non-ASCII letters, except for Turkish layouts; the cure is worse than
      the disease because it makes Caps Lock equivalent to Shift Lock.
    - Set keymap and font in the initramfs if possible.
    - Set default variant for French to oss.
    - Fix handling of commas in layout and variant names.
    - Fix keymap reduction not to try to express keymap A in terms of keymap
      B when B includes keys not mapped by A.
    - debian/config.proto: Set sparc default model to pc105.
    - Remove 'exit 0' from the end of debian/config.proto; this will be
      sourced from the postinst in the installer, and exiting in the
      successful case means that /etc/default/console-setup never gets
      generated.
    - Set default model to pc105 on powerpc/ps3 systems.
  * Switch back to console-tools-udeb for now; we'd like to use kbd for
    Hardy, but Alpha 1 is looming ...
  * Stop running debconf-updatepo on clean; this is not standard in d-i and
    should be done manually where necessary in Ubuntu.
  * Backport from trunk:
    - Run setupcon with --save in the postinst to ensure that required data
      is copied to /etc.
    - Load the saved keymap in /etc/console-setup/boottime.kmap.gz if
      available rather than running ckbcomp (which is slow), unless we're

    - remove outdated note about loadkeys in console-setup-udeb's

    - Add a few bits of installer integration to console-setup-udeb

    I disabled the code for making UTF-8 default charmap in d-i because
    there are locales which use other charmap.  However I made setupcon to

    Watson:
    - Do not sorce the debconf library in the middle of the postinst,
      closes: #420831.
    - Remove from the source package several directories
      debian/UDEB-PACKAGE-NAME.  (The udebs were removed from
      debian/control before running the clean target.)  Closes: #420912.
    - Map fr_CH locale to Swiss French default keyboard
      layout in config.proto.  Closes: #420828.
    - Pass xkbdir variable on the make-command line, because else its
      value is overriden and the keymap definitions in Keyboard/ckb are
      used.  Closes: #420827.
    - A new option --save-only for setupcon.
    - Ship KeyboardNames.pl and kbdnames-maker.  Closes: #420914.
    - Fix Esperanto locale check in config.proto, closes: #420785.  Make
      'epo' the default layout for Esperanto.
    - The Bosnian layout is 'ba', not 'bs'.  Closes: #420787.
    - The layout variant is 'deva', not 'dev'.  Closes: #420797.
    - Do not leave empty default codeset for unsupported locales.
      Closes: #420802.  
    - Use 'jp(latin)' instead of 'us' in the Latin mode of Japanese
      keyboards.  Override the keyboard model if it was chosen by default
      and the layout is Japanese or Brasilian.  Closes: #420824.
    - Add --save-only option to setupcon.  Closes: #420832.
    - Multiply the Installer-Menu-Item field of the udebs by 100.
      Closes: #421260.
    - By default do not use AltGr with basic US keyboard.  Closes: #421263.
    - Make sure amiga, ataritt, sun4 and sun5 are in KeyboardNames.pl even
      if they are not in the xml database.  Closes: #420821.
    - Talk about 'national' instead of 'non-Latin' mode in the templates.
      Treat the Lithuanian keyboard as a two-mode keyboard similarly to
      the Serbian keyboard.  Closes: #421261.
  * Do not ignore the Control+ and Alt+non_symbol_key combinations.
    Thanks to Karsten Hilbert, closes: #421796.
  * Two additions to the FAQ:
    - Add a suggestion for the VBERestore option.  Thanks to Dmitry
      Semyonov, closes: #402143.
    - Document CapsLock working as ShiftLock in Unicode mode.
  * Added manual page for setupcon.  Thanks to Vassilis Pandis,
    closes: #405005. 
  * Added Dutch translation.  Thanks to Bart Cornelis, closes: #415518.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.

    - Map fr_CH to ch(fr) (Swiss French).
    - Fix codeset question priority for Esperanto.
    - Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in

  * Back out part of setup-console-under-usplash changes: attempts to change
    the font must be guarded against being run while on an X display or
    while usplash is running, because some kernel console drivers (at least
    vgacon) are fundamentally unable to change the font only on some virtual
    consoles, and will corrupt video memory if you try (LP: #73955). We now
    use setupcon --save-only to make sure the font is available on the root

    - Only default to Canadian layout for fr_CA; use U.S. English for other
      *_CA locales.
    - Fix default layout for Bosnian and default variant for Hindi.
    - Set default charmap for d-i to UTF-8.
    - Remove unhelpful defaults for several questions.
    - Adjust the default keyboard model for Brazilian and Japanese layouts.
    - Allow preseeding of console-setup/modelcode, console-setup/layoutcode,
      console-setup/variantcode, console-setup/optionscode, and
      console-setup/fontsize.
    - Use jp(latin),jp rather than us,jp by default for Japanese.
    - Reset console-setup/toggle to the default if it's set to "No toggling"
      and you select a non-Latin layout.
    - Change the default font from Terminus to VGA where supported.
    - Skip now-unnecessary console check in init scripts.
    - Fix up font face and size on upgrading from old versions in Edgy.
    - Add a few bits of installer integration to console-setup-udeb borrowed
      from kbd-chooser.
    - console-setup Depends: perl; something in ckbcomp is causing perl to
      'use utf8' implicitly, and some of the necessary modules aren't in
      perl-base.
    - Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
      tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out
      of raw mode is a very bad idea.
  * Restore udeb generation.

  * Map fr_CH to ch(fr) (Swiss French).
  * Include ch(fr) in keymap tree.
  * Fix codeset question priority for Esperanto.
  * Remove X and usplash checks in keyboard-setup and console-setup init
    scripts, since neither are needed following the fix in console-setup
    1.7ubuntu19.
  * Allow setupcon to be run on install again, for the same reason.
  * Automatically save the font and keymap to /etc in
    /etc/init.d/console-setup if it isn't being run from init; this allows
    us to tolerate XKB data being moved to /usr. Similarly, ensure that the
    font and keymap are saved to /etc during initial installation.

  * Update the version of the Terminus font from 4.16 to 4.20.  (This is

    pipe.  Thanks to Tollef Fog Heen.
  * config.proto: Handle C locale with debian-installer/locale not being

    first Debconf question.  In the template file change "none" to "this
    default value is completely ignored".  Thanks to Colin Watson, 
    closes: #386837.
  * Handle properly the cs layout in config.proto and kbdcompiler.  Thanks
    to Colin Watson, closes: #386838.
  * Supply correct debian/po/POTFILES.in.  Thanks to Thomas Huriaux,
    closes: #387631.
  * Use /lib/lsb/init-functions in the init scripts when available.
    Thanks to Colin Watson, closes: #386844.
  * config.proto: Try to use the value of debian-installer/keymap to get
    default keyboard layout and variant and when that is possible ask the
    corresponding Debconf questions with medium instead of critical
    priority.  Thanks to Colin Watson, closes: #386836.
  * config.proto(ask_debconf): when the provided default value is
    unavailable, try to use the empty string.  Useful when asking for the
    keyboard variant.
  * Add README.Debian for console-setup.
  * Add boot script order header to the init scripts.  Thanks to

console-setup (1.7ubuntu19) edgy; urgency=low

  * If upgrading from an older version than this one, check for the Terminus
    font face and change it to VGA (if you do like it, you can change it
    back and it won't be touched again). If Terminus was in use, also check
    for the 12x6 font size and change it to 16, since that was apparently
    selected due to a strange use-of-debconf bug.
  * Run kbd_mode on each tty in ACTIVE_CONSOLES rather than on the current
    tty, since the current tty might belong to X and changing X's tty out of
    raw mode is a very bad idea (closes: Malone #66929; requires kbd 1.12-15
    or console-tools 1:0.2.3dbs-62ubuntu10).
  * Adjust the default keyboard model for Brazilian (closes: Malone #66774)
    and Japanese (closes: Malone #66719) layouts.

  * Change the default font to VGA where supported; Terminus does not seem
    to have widespread aesthetic appeal.
  * Use jp(latin),jp rather than us,jp by default for Japanese, and set the
    model to jp106 (closes: Malone #63915).

console-setup (1.7ubuntu12) edgy; urgency=low

  * Don't run the init script (and thereby setupcon) on upgrade; just print
    a message telling you to run setupcon from a virtual console if you want
    to update your console configuration (closes: Malone #61723).
  * Update debian-installer/keymap handling from trunk (Anton Zinoviev).
    Drop /etc/X11/xorg.conf upgrade handling, also per trunk, as I've been
    convinced that that is much less safe due to the prevalence of GNOME/KDE
    keymap overrides, and furthermore it made it more difficult to have
    ubiquity tell console-setup just to guess a default from the locale.
  * Drop the priority of the model and layout questions to medium if a
    configuration file already exists, since they'll have been asked at
    medium first time round and if we then ask them at critical the second
    time round they will be unexpectedly shown (closes: Malone #59883).

  * Don't set up the console font at boot time if usplash is running, since

console-setup (1.7ubuntu9) edgy; urgency=low

  * Switch build-dependency and dependency back to xkb-data, now that it's

console-setup (1.7ubuntu6) edgy; urgency=low

  * If there's no console-setup configuration when console-setup.config
    runs, then:
    - If there is an xorg.conf, set the defaults from there.
    - Failing that, if debian-installer/keymap is set, try to guess correct
      defaults from that using the same algorithm as formerly applied by
      xserver-xorg.config. The only serious change I made to the algorithm
      is that it now maps (mac-usb-)uk to plain gb, not gb(intl), since
      that's closer to what UK keyboard users generally expect.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri,  8 Sep 2006 00:13:26 +0100

  * Use keymapper to generate decision trees for a restricted subset of the
    pc105 model. (I tried building trees for the whole model, but this took
    far too long.)
  * If the detect-keyboard debconf plugin is available
    (cdebconf-newt-detect-keys in the installer), then offer to use it to
    detect the keyboard layout.
  * Fix debian/po/POTFILES.in to point to console-setup.templates.
  * Make console-setup-udeb depend on console-setup-fonts-udeb, at least for
    now.
  * Convert init script to LSB logging functions.
  * Add a few bits of installer integration to console-setup-udeb borrowed
    from kbd-chooser (/lib/debian-installer.d/S55console-setup,

    on the console or not.  That way setupcon can detect that we are on
    the console even when it is invoked from postinst and Debconf has
    changed standard input and output.
  * Changes in the text of some questions: "What is the origin of our
    keyboard" instead of "What is the layout of your keyboard" and "What
    is the layout of your keyboard" instead of "What is the variant of
    your keyboard".  Ask the console-setup/variant question with critical
    priority.  Thanks to Arnt Karlsen, closes: #352405.
