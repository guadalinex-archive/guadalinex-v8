ERROR: The OEM installer failed. Your system may not be usable yet. Please
report this as a bug to your vendor.

To create a user so that you can use your new system normally, type:

    adduser USERNAME

... replacing USERNAME with the username you would like to use (your first
name in lower case is normally a reasonable choice), and follow the prompts.
If this succeeds, type 'exit' to reboot the system.
