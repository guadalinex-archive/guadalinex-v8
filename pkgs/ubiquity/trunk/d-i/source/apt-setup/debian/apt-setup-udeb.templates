_Description: Services to use:
 Debian has two services that provide updates to releases: security and
 volatile.
 .
 Security updates help to keep your system secured against attacks. Enabling
 this service is strongly recommended.
 .
 Volatile updates provide more current versions for software that changes
 relatively frequently and where not having the latest version could reduce
 the usability of the software. An example is the virus signatures for a virus
 scanner. This service is only available for stable and oldstable releases.

# All services except partner and extras are enabled by default to allow
# preseeding; partner will be automatically disabled if non-free software is
# disabled.  For convenience, preseeding apt-setup/partner or
# apt-setup/extras will automatically enable the respective services.
