  * Resynchronise with Debian.  Remaining changes:
    - Use and depend on the Ubuntu keyring.
    - Enable the restricted component by default, unless
      apt-setup/restricted is preseeded to false.
    - Set up the default sources.list to look in -updates and -security (the
      latter from apt-setup/security_host) as well as the unadorned suite;
      also -proposed if apt-setup/proposed is true.
    - Use Ubuntu kernel image names.
    - Allow preseeding base-installer/kernel/override-image to force a given
      kernel to be used.
    - Install busybox-initramfs rather than busybox.
    - Revert Joey's patch to call base-installer.d hooks after running
      debootstrap, which broke console-setup's expectation of being able to
      insert its configuration file into /target before console-setup is
      installed by debootstrap.
    - Add armel/imx51, armel/dove, and armel/omap subarchitectures.
    - Install kernel headers to match the kernel. This may be overridden by
      setting base-installer/kernel/headers to false.
    - Add base-installer/kernel/backports-modules template, which may be
      preseeded to install selected linux-backports-modules-* packages.
    - Run dpkg with --force-unsafe-io during installation.
  * Explicitly drop code supporting -386 kernels, which were dropped from
    Ubuntu some time ago.

  * Pass --no-check-gpg to debootstrap when not using http/ftp,
    or when allow_unauthenticated is set, since debootstrap has
    changed to validating the keyring when present by default.
