README for Computer Janitor Core
================================


Computer Janitor is a tool to clean up a system so that it is more like
a freshly installed one. It was written for Ubuntu, but should be
possible to port to other Unix-like operating systems.

This is the core of the program: the plugin manager, and (some of) the
plugins. The user interface and some other things are in a separate
source tree. This is because Ubuntu's and Debian's Update Manager
program will be using Computer Janitor. Since Update Manager is used
also to upgrade from operating system release to release, it needs to
keep its external dependencies to a minimum. Thus, the core of Computer
Janitor is incorporated into Update Manager, and the upper layers will
remain as a separate package.
