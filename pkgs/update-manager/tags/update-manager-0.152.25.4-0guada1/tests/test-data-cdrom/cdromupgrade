# "cdromupgrade" is a shell script wrapper around the dist-upgrader
# to make it possible to put it onto the top-level dir of a CD and
# run it from there
# 
# Not that useful unfortunately when the CD is mounted "noexec".
#
# WARNING: make sure to call it with a absolute path!
#          (e.g. /cdrom/cdromupgrade)
