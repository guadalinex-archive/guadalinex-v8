= Ubuntu 11.10 'Oneiric Ocelot' is no longer supported =

You are about to upgrade to a version of Ubuntu that is no longer
supported.

This release of Ubuntu is '''no longer supported''' by Canonical. The
support timeframe is between 18 month and 5 years after the initial
release. You will not receive security updates or critical
bugfixes. See http://www.ubuntu.com/releaseendoflife for details.

It is still possible to upgrade this version and eventually you will
be able to upgrade to a supported release of Ubuntu.

Alternatively you may want to consider to reinstall the machine to the
latest version, for more information on this, visit:

For pre-installed system you may want to contact the manufacturer
for instructions.
