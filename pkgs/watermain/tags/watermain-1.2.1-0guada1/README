WATERMAIN SAMPLE FILE. DO NOT USE IN REAL DISTROS.

- watermain.list is made of sections
- Every section starts with #TITLE: (or #TITLE=) and ends with #END
- Case is important!
- Lines outside sections are ignored
- Enclose the urls needed for sources.list in a section
- Add a unique #ID to allow watermain highlighting the actual mirror
- Move it to /etc/watermain.list
