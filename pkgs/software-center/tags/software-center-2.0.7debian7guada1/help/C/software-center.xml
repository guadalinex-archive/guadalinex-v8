    <title>What is Software Center?</title>
    <para>
      Software Center is a virtual catalog of thousands of free
      applications and other software to make your computer more useful.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can find software by category or by searching,
      and you can install an item with the click of a button.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Center also lets you examine the software installed on the
      computer already,
      and remove anything you no longer need.
    </para>
  </chapter>
  <chapter id="installing">
    <title>Installing software</title>
    <para>
      To install something with Software Center,
      you need administrator access and a working Internet connection.
      (If you set up the operating system on this computer yourself,
      you have administrator access automatically.)
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          In the <guilabel>Get Software</guilabel> section,
          find the thing you want to install.
          If you already know its name, try typing the name in the search field.
          Or try searching for the type of program you want
          (like &#8220;spreadsheet&#8221;).
          Otherwise, browse the list of departments.

          before the installation can begin.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
      How long something takes to install depends on how large it is,
      and the speed of your computer and Internet connection.
    </para>
    <para>
      When the screen changes to say &#8220;Installed&#8221;,
      the software is ready to use.

      Most installed applications appear
      in the <guimenu>Applications</guimenu> menu in the corner of the screen,
      in the same category as they came from in the Software Center.
    </para>
    <para>
      For example, if you installed a program from the
      <guilabel>Office</guilabel> department, it will appear inside
      <menuchoice><guimenu>Applications</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Office</guisubmenu></menuchoice>.

      Utilities for changing settings may appear inside

    <para>
      Sometimes if you try to remove one item,
      the Software Center will warn you that other items will be removed too.
      There are two main reasons this happens.
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          If you remove an application, any add-ons or accessories
          for that application usually will be removed too.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Multiple applications are sometimes provided as a single package.
          If any of them are installed, all of them are installed.
          And if any of them are removed, all of them are removed.
          Software Center cannot remove them individually,
          because it has no instructions on how to separate them.
        </para>
      </listitem>

    <para>
      You can use the <guilabel>Main Menu</guilabel> settings to hide unwanted
      items without removing them from the computer.
      In GNOME, you can find <guilabel>Main Menu</guilabel> inside
      <menuchoice><guimenu>System</guimenu>

    <para>
      Some of the software available in Ubuntu Software Center is
      maintained by Canonical.
      Canonical engineers ensure that security fixes and other critical updates
      are provided for these programs.
    </para>
    <para>
      Other software is maintained by the Ubuntu developer community.
      Any updates are provided on a best-effort basis.

    <para>
      Currently, all software in Software Center is free of charge.
    </para>
    <para>
      Most of this software is developed as <firstterm>open source</firstterm>,
      which means anyone is allowed to alter it and redistribute it for any
      price.
      Ubuntu developers, Debian developers, and others
      package the software available in Software Center,
      and make it available to you for free.

      First, check that <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu>
      <guimenuitem>All Software</guimenuitem></menuchoice> is selected.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the software you want still isn&#8217;t there,
      but you know that it runs on this operating system,
      try contacting the original developers of the program
      to ask if they can help make it available.
    </para>
    <para>
      If a program is available for other operating systems but not for this one,
      let the developers know that you&#8217;re interested in running it on
      this operating system.

    <para>
      With tens of thousands of programs in Software Center,
      there&#8217;s always the chance that a few of them won&#8217;t work
      properly on your computer.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you are familiar with reporting bugs in software,
      you can help out by reporting the problem to the developers,
      see <ulink url="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting">
      http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting</ulink> for
      information on how to report a bug in Debian. If you do not
      run Debian, but a distribution based on it, you might need to
      report the bug to another address.
    </para>
    <para>
      Otherwise, look through the Center for another program to do what you want.
