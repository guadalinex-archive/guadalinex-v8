Description: This is a sample string question.
 This is its extended description.
 .
 Notice that:
  - Like in a debian package description, a dot
    on its own line sets off a new paragraph.
  - Most text is word-wrapped, but doubly-indented
    text is left alone, so you can use it for lists
    of items, like this list. Be careful, since
    it is not word-wrapped, if it's too wide
    it will look bad. Using it for short items
    is best (so this is a bad example).
